This app is created as part of my training at the [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org).

</div>


<ul>
<li>This is a simple social network project built with Ruby on Rails.</li>
<li>It allows users to sign up then log into the app before being allowed to post gossips, comment and like other gossips.</li>
<li>This project trained me on building a complete Rails web app using the MVC architecture and PostgreSQL database.</li>
<li>The aim was to pratice user authentication, full CRUD implementation & routing (+ having some fun with creating seeds for our app :wink: ).</li>
<ul>


<br>
<br>

## Features
* The homepage display gossips pr√©sents in a database and a welcome message.
* This gossips have been randomly generated by the Faker gem.
* Every gossips has his own page with a dynamic link.
